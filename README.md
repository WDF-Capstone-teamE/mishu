Personal Demo Instructions:

Download the ‘viro media app’ for your device
Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viromedia.viromedia&hl=en_US
Apple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/viro-media/id1163100576


Open the app and click the top left button (looks like a three-lined equal sign)

Press “Enter Testbed”
Run "npm start" in the project repo and enter the ngrok.io address provided.

After pressing ‘GO’ you’ll have to wait momentarily (~30-60 seconds) while your device pulls the necessary files to run the application. May require shaking the device and pressing ‘reload’.

**Thanks**
A special thanks to the artist(@omabuarts) who spent so much time helping us try to integrate their 3D model into the app by attempting to fix an issue with converting models from .fbx to Viro-react's own .vrx file type, although they were under no obligation to do so. 
Although we were unable to get the model functional for our app in time, we did not want the model to go to waste. We asked, and and they kindly granted, permission for us to make the model available for education purposes to all other students at Fullstack Academy.

And a huge thank you to our Logo designer, Amy Sanchez
